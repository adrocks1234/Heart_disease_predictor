## Objective

The aim of this project is to predict whether a person can have a heart disease or not using Logistic Regression.It predicts a dependent variable based on one or more set of independent variables to predict outcomes . It can be used both for binary classification and multi-class classification.
## Dataset

The dataset contains 13 attributes,and the goal is to predict the target which determines whether the person concerned has a diseased heart or not.1 determines that he has heart disease and 0 signifying that he doesn't have heart disease
## Content
The following are the 13 attributes of the dataset

1.age 2.sex 3.chest pain type (4 values) 4.resting blood pressure 5.serum cholestoral in mg/dl 6.fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl 7.resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2) 8.maximum heart rate achieved 9.exercise induced angina 10.oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 11.the slope of the peak exercise ST segment 12.number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy 13.thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
## Tools Used

Pandas,Numpy and Scikit Learn have been used for data manipulation and analysis
